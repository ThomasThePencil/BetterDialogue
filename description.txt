have you ever found yourself fantastically bored by the vanilla dialogue panel?
are you looking for a more intimately and readily available NPC chat system?
do you seek PASSION? ROMANCE!? someone who can LIVE UP TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS?!?

...well, you won't find any of that last bit here, save for possibly the part about expectations.
what you WILL find, however, is Dialect, a...framework? API? what's the word I'm lookin' for?...that aims to overhaul the livin' hell outta dialogue internally for better use (and abuse, of course) by modders.
to clarify, Dialect isn't meant to be a standalone mod (though a demonstrative change to the Guide's craftin' button are made in the UI/Examples folder).
it's instead intended, most predominantly, for use by other mods as a way to add more diverse dialogue displays.
if you wanna learn how to use it, just check out the GitHub page (helpfully provided as the "homepage" or linked on the Steam Workshop page you subbed on) and get to workin'!

as a framework for chat modification, Dialect comes pre-equipped with the followin' useful things to help you learn:
- a well-documented chat button modification example that even applies in-game for ease of demonstration!
- thorough XML documentation on every currently-available aspect of Dialect's API!
- a freshened-up version of the vanilla dialogue style as an alternative option, for those just a little tired of the vanilla flair!
- a few configuration options to generally apply to dialogue styles! note that dialogue styles don't HAVE to obey these; they just CAN (and SHOULD, though I can't force any of 'em to)

(NOTE: this mod assumes that you're willin' to use it as a dependency. if this isn't your speed, I wouldn't bother; the mod has NO Mod.Call support whatsoever, and I don't plan to add any, as doin' so would defeat the point)

----- CHANGELOGS BELOW ----

v1.1.4.1:
- reverted the UI scale changes from 1.1.4, as they made more problems than they solved
- add some filler to your window tile sheets! turns out, that was the sole issue all along. BOY, do I feel dumb

v1.1.4:
- added proper UI scale support! Dialect's windows should now support non-standard UI scale choices
  - note: at the time of writin', the Tax Collector's "Collect" button currently doesn't scale perfectly. I'll be labbin' out how to fix this at a later point in time
- fixed a long-standin' issue with button hover boxes on Classic-type styles, causin' hover boxes to be slightly wrong
- fixed the Purify Button havin' the Status text and lettin' you infinitely produce the funny Stardew Valley fruit
- did a bunch of refactorin' to the source to (hopefully) make it easier to read

v1.1.3:
FINALLY fixed signs! signs and adjacent should now be wholly compatible with all of Dialect's changes and improvements

v1.1.2:
- added a Priority property for all chat buttons which decides what order they're drawn/listed in; vanilla chat buttons have been updated accordingly with concrete priority values
- added a ModifyPosition hook for (Global)ChatButton which allows modification of a button's draw position before it's drawn
- added a bit more documentation

v1.1.1:
- added the ability for dialogue styles to add a flat amount to the width of dialogue boxes through the new BoxWidthModifier property
- added a ForceActive hook for (Global)DialogueStyle which can allow you to set a certain dialogue style as active without changin' the one you already have selected
- if Dialogue Panel Rework is also enabled, Dialect's window now overrides DPR's for supported NPCs (unsupported NPCs will still use DPR's as appropriate)
- fixed happiness button displayin' for town pets/slimes
- fixed happiness button displayin' far too early in button order
- fixed an oversight causin' chat button color hooks to never be called in DrawClassicButtons
- added even more documentation

v1.1:
- added a list in the mod class called SupportedNPCs. this list contains the numerical IDs of every NPC that can be spoken with which works with Dialect. if an NPC isn't in this list, the vanilla dialogue window is used. this should ease a lot of compatibility issues to a certain degree
- added GlobalDialogueStyle, which contains PreDraw and PostDraw hooks. currently slightly basic, but I want to be careful with this, so unless other new features for global styles are requested, this will be all
- moved DrawDialogueStyle to DialogueStyleLoader, renamed it to DrawActiveDialogueStyle, and added global style support to it
- DialogueStyle now has a Draw method which you can override; by default, this simply calls DrawClassic
- removed the Example Mod activations since they're useless
- fixed an oversight resultin' in the town NPC happiness button never bein' added to the list of active buttons
- substantially improved documentation in multiple places

v1.0.2:
- changed how the shop button works so that modded NPCs can be properly made to work
- added an example for how to make modded NPCs able to be shopped at, which also automagically calls the relevant method for all Example Mod shop NPCs
- the mod should now more effectively get its data outta your way on unload

v1.0.1:
- fixed the mod's icon bein' too small

v1.0:
- initial release
